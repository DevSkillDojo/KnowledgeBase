Domain Model
============

The skills domain model serves as a strcutural definition of all the concepts related to the skills domain. 
It helps us to define each concept as well as how each concept is related to others.
Effectively, it is the underpinning data model of the DSD skills framework.

The UML diagram below provides a visual depiction of the metamodel, which is then further elaborated in the glossary that follows the diagram:
