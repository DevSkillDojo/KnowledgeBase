DSD Skills Framework
====================

Date Release: 2020-03-02
Version: 0.0.1

The diagram below provides a high level depiction of the DevSkillDojo Skills Framework. The intention of this framework is to provide
a considered method for structuring skills. Additionally, the framework serves as a guideline to prevent one-dimensional thinking
w.r.t. skills, i.e. always equating skills with technologies.

Key Point for understanding the purpose of the framework: Projects and products are delivered by people with capabilities.
The dictionary definition of "Capability" is roughly: The ability to do <something>

But it is important to give more structure to this definition, so we use the following pattern:

A CAPABILITY is generally:
 * The application of one or more HARD SKILLS,
 * Guided by pre-existing underlying KNOWLEDGE
 * Using one or more TOOLS or TECHNOLOGIES
 * By a person with a set of SOFT SKILLS
