Skills Tree
===========

Note, this skills tree is the base of the skills framework which will become the core of the company.
It lists and classifies skills - however, to build a comprehensive list requires sifting through a lot of
junk. The result is that I'm adding lists of things from many sources.

When I add an item, I spend only a few seconds on it, so the assessment of whether it really belongs in the list is
very basic. In most cases, I will simply add a (??) to the skill name, which implies it will require
additional review later.

To determine if something is actually a skill, we ask the following questions:
* Are the learning resources to learn this skill
* Can I be certified in this
* Can my performance be measured in this
* Of course sometimes the item just needs to be broken down further to give clarity

Eventually all skills should be fully defined
